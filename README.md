# STEVE JOBS CLASS MANAGEMENT

This product is a **management software** developed by five of Steve Jobs Academy's students, with the intent of **automate all of the usual operations** used by the Steve Jobs Academy regarding the **managing** of all the students, the teachers, the subjects and the grades.


The **APIs** use the RESTful approach, and the Database used is **MONGODB**.

  # _NPM commands:_
    
   :loop: Run `npm start` to start the distributed server :loop:

 # The following list shows how we structured the file system:

 ## The _**source**_ folder (_**src**_): :notebook_with_decorative_cover:
  * models folder :ledger:
  * routes folder :ledger:
  * tests folder :ledger:
  * app.ts files :page_with_curl:
  
 
  
  
### The _***models***_ folder contains:
  * _**Helpers**_ folder: :man: :woman:
  
    Inside helpers folder you can find the scheme of every single person, that includes **personal data**.
    This helps us structure both students and teachers 
  * _**Interfaces**_ folder:
  
    It is a typescript construct, and containes the interfaces of every single teacher, subject and student.
