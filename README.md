This product is a **management software** developed by five of Steve Jobs Academy's students, with the intent of **automate all of the usual operations** used by the Steve Jobs Academy regarding the **managing** of all the students, the teachers, the subjects and the grades.


The **APIs** used are structured in **REST Architecture**, and the Database used is **MONGODB**.



 # The following list shows how we structured the file system:

 ## The _**source**_ folder (_**src**_):
  * models folder
  * routes folder
  * tests folder
  * apps.ts files
  
 `codice atteso da manuel e matteo`
  
  
### The _***models***_ folder contains:
  * _**Helpers**_ folder:
  
    Inside helpers folder you can find the scheme of every single person, that includes **personal data**.
    This helps us structure both students and teachers 
  * _**Interfaces**_ folder:
  
    It is a typescript construct, and containes the interfaces of every single teacher, subject and student.
  * _**And four files**_:
    * students
    * teachers
    * subjects
    * grades
